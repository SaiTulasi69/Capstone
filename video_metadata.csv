jPcvXB6xrsg,Djokovic deported after losing visa appeal,"Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia and will not play in the Australian Open after losing his visa appeal to stay in the country.

Three Federal Court judges upheld a decision to cancel the unvaccinated tennis star's visa on public interest grounds.

The Serb now looks set for a three-year ban from Australia, a move that will hinder his attempt to win 21 grand slams and become the greatest player of all time.

The 34-year-old said he was “extremely disappointed” by the decision.

4dJZuAHriNQ,RUMBLE LIVE: Australia’s Deportation of Novak Djokovic,"Following is the live video we published yesterday reporting on the deportation of the unvaccinated tennis star Novak Djokovic from Australia. The original link is here: https://rumble.com/vsphzb-australias-deportation-of-novak-djokovic.html

Note that the Australian government, in deporting Djokovic, did not contend that he posed a threat to the public health due to a risk of transmitting COVID. The opposite is true: the government acknowledged that he qualified for a legal exemption from the vaccine requirement to enter the country given that he just contracted COVID as reflected by a December 16 positive test, followed by a negative test on December 22, and therefore has high levels of natural immunity. That is why he received a legal visa to enter Australia despite being unvaccinated. The proffered justification from Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, who cancelled his visa and ordered him deported, was that Djokovic’s statements in April, 2020 implied that he was skeptical of vaccines, and the presence of someone in Australia who is viewed as an “icon” of personal choice would foster social disruption and “excite” anti-vaccine sentiments.

In other words, the principle just embraced by the Australian government and upheld by its judicial system (whose hands were largely tied due to the virtually absolute power vested in the government) is that anyone who has ever expressed any skepticism over vaccines in general, or the COVID vaccine in particular, can and should be denied entrance to the country and be prevented from pursuing their livelihood — even though the government admits they pose no threat to the public health by transmitting the virus to others. Immigration lawyers and civil liberties activists in the country are warning of the grave dangers posed to everyone from this precedent, and I examine all of the implications of this decision.",2022-01-17T16:09:44Z,UChzVhAwzGR7hV-4O8ZmBLHg,Glenn Greenwald,25,29058,2763,0,UgxaTKMHDhSEkgggyuh4AaABAg,"Djokovic and others can fight back by claiming ownership of their sport, and making tons of money in the process:

Vaccinated or not, people experience a deep fear for their lives. I come from Israel (although I don't live there anymore), where it doesn't matter how strong and big of an military we have, people still fear for their lives on one hand, and glorify their huge military on the other hand. Same with the pandemic. Therefore when someone question the vaccine and it's efficacy, what they really do, and how it really being perceived, is to metaphorically take away from the petrified the one thing they feel can protect them. It's all psychological. So when I advocate for peace, or even for a smaller military budget in Israel, people perceive it as literal death threat to their lives. It's all subconscious of course. That's why it is so difficult to debate.
So when an unvaccinated tennis player comes in to a country that suffered the harshest of lockdowns, what created huge fear levels in the population (cause what is more scary and dystopian than the government asking you to stay home for your own safety?), what he really does it defying and potentially taking down the only psychological defense they have created against the crisis. This is why everybody became so authoritarian so quickly and without asking question. Fear. Hermann Göring has a quote about this from his cell in the Nuremberg Trials. He said of course the people don't wanna go to war. But it's easy to get them on board. It works the same way in any country. Doesn't matter the system in place. All you need to do is to tell them they are under attack (today it is covid) and blame the pacifists in their lack of patriotism (today you blame the critics in causing the death of people by not getting vaccinated). So the threat is covid, and a any unvaccinated or critic even of the policies is the anti patriot. And here it is, working the same way exactly.",2022-02-08T15:14:48Z,PT42M5S

ifqopbd_pDc,Tennis villain Holger Rune scolded by umpire after latest piece of controversy,"Tennis villain Holger Rune scolded by umpire after latest piece of controversy

Holger Rune has once again found himself at the centre of controversy following a fresh incident on Monday.
The fiery 20-year-old was bundled out of the Madrid Open on Monday in the round of 32 at the hands of Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
Rune, the sixth seed, was sent packing in a three-set encounter that lasted over three hours as the 29th seed prevailed 7-6, 5-7, 7-6.
Controversy however exploded in the opening set with the young Dane called out for appearing to brush away a close line call.
A point in the second set that was called good was brought into question by Fokina who was convinced it was out with chair umpire Carlos Bernardes agreeing with the Spanish player.
The electronic line however deemed the serve had landed in which frustrated Fokina and saw him call for the match supervisor.
As he argued his point Rune was seen walking over to inspect the mark with one foot going extremely close to where it had landed.
Fans in attendance blew up believing he had erased the mark with his foot which prompted them to turn against the young star for the remainder of the match.
Shortly after the incident unfolded Bernardes was captured giving the current world number seven a stern talking too.
“I told you once in Monte Carlo, but that was fine. There are crowds that you cannot control if you do things like that … they will be worse if you keep doing it. If you just play tennis, they don’t do anything else,” said Bernardes to Rune.
“I’m just trying to help you to go through this as I have experience here that you can’t play if they start to do it. For them what you did with erasing the mark, there was no reason for that.”
The crowd didn’t hold back with their anger towards him as they let go a chorus of boos throughout the match, including in between his serves.
Fokina said the energy of the crowd behind him helped fuel him in the marathon encounter and go him over the line.
“I felt that energy & I was like ‘I don’t want to go home..’ it doesn’t matter if I’m cramping, doesn’t matter if I have tension, but I want to win this match. It’s very late, it’s incredible that people stayed here and supported me,” he said.
The win sets up a round of round 16 against the 17th seeded Borna Coric who took care of business against 12th seed Hubert Hurkacz in straight sets, 7-6 6-3.


Holger Rune is currently playing Alejandro Davidovich-Fokina at the Madrid Open and as ever drama follows the Dane around including in this match involving umpire Carlos Bernardes.
Rune was scolded by Bernardes saying that he erased the mark that Davidovich Fokina complained about earlier in the match which was a heavily debated call.

The mark was already reviewed so erasing it did little but it still made for drama as Bernardes gave Rune a word of warning as the crowd continued to get on his back.
""I told you once in Monte Carlo, but that was fine. There are crowds that you cannot control if you do things like that… they will be worse if you keep doing it. If you just play tennis, they don’t do anything else,"" said Bernardes to Rune.
""I'm just trying to help you to go through this as I have experience here that you can't play if they start to do it. For them what you did with erasing the mark, there was no reason for that.""",2023-05-01T12:51:33Z,UCqMKXgAFfQBqKHh7xpXKmrQ,Night Sport,17,5467,3,0,UgxY9qMb3akqgc4EU1Z4AaABAg,"He's not a villain, neither is Kyrgios.

Holger Rune has once again found himself at the centre of controversy following a fresh incident on Monday.
The fiery 20-year-old was bundled out of the Madrid Open on Monday in the round of 32 at the hands of Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
Rune, the sixth seed, was sent packing in a three-set encounter that lasted over three hours as the 29th seed prevailed 7-6, 5-7, 7-6.
Controversy however exploded in the opening set with the young Dane called out for appearing to brush away a close line call.
A point in the second set that was called good was brought into question by Fokina who was convinced it was out with chair umpire Carlos Bernardes agreeing with the Spanish player.
The electronic line however deemed the serve had landed in which frustrated Fokina and saw him call for the match supervisor.
As he argued his point Rune was seen walking over to inspect the mark with one foot going extremely close to where it had landed.
Fans in attendance blew up believing he had erased the mark with his foot which prompted them to turn against the young star for the remainder of the match.
Shortly after the incident unfolded Bernardes was captured giving the current world number seven a stern talking too.
“I told you once in Monte Carlo, but that was fine. There are crowds that you cannot control if you do things like that … they will be worse if you keep doing it. If you just play tennis, they don’t do anything else,” said Bernardes to Rune.
“I’m just trying to help you to go through this as I have experience here that you can’t play if they start to do it. For them what you did with erasing the mark, there was no reason for that.”
The crowd didn’t hold back with their anger towards him as they let go a chorus of boos throughout the match, including in between his serves.
Fokina said the energy of the crowd behind him helped fuel him in the marathon encounter and go him over the line.
“I felt that energy & I was like ‘I don’t want to go home..’ it doesn’t matter if I’m cramping, doesn’t matter if I have tension, but I want to win this match. It’s very late, it’s incredible that people stayed here and supported me,” he said.
The win sets up a round of round 16 against the 17th seeded Borna Coric who took care of business against 12th seed Hubert Hurkacz in straight sets, 7-6 6-3.
