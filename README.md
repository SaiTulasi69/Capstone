The emergence of social media platforms has brought about both opportunities and challenges, particularly with regards to user engagement and communication. This study focuses on analyzing the variance between early and steady state responses to political overtones on YouTube. The objective is to investigate the difference between comments made by users before and after the midpoint of the video, based on comment timestamps, video timestamps, and duration. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques will be employed to classify comments as either early or steady state responses, and to extract meaningful insights from the data. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of user engagement and communication on social media platforms, particularly in the context of political discourse.
